This post gives an overview of the recent updates to the _Writing an OS in Rust_ blog and the used libraries and tools.

My focus this month was to finish the [_Heap Allocation_](@/edition-2/posts/10-heap-allocation/index.md) post, on which I had been working since March. I originally wanted to include a section about different allocator designs (bump, linked list, slab, â€¦) and how to implement them, but I decided to split it out into a separate post because it became much too long. I try to release this half-done post soon.

Apart from the new post, there were some minor updates to the `x86_64`, `bootloader` and `cargo-xbuild` crates. The following gives a short overview of notable changes to the different projects.
