This post gives an overview of the recent updates to the _Writing an OS in Rust_ blog and the corresponding libraries and tools.

## `blog_os`

The repository of the _Writing an OS in Rust_ blog received the following updates:

- [Move #[global_allocator] into allocator module](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/714)
- [Update many_boxes test to scale with heap size](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/716)
- [New post about allocator designs](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/719) ðŸŽ‰
- [Provide multiple implementations of align_up and mention performance](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/721)
- [Refactor Simplified Chinese translation of post 3](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/725) by [@Rustin-Liu](https://github.com/Rustin-Liu)
- [Use checked addition for allocator implementations](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/726)
- [Fix dummy allocator code example](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/728)
- [Some style updates to the front page](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/729)

I also started working on the upcoming post about threads.

## `bootloader`

The bootloader crate received two minor updates this month:

- [Move architecture checks from build script into lib.rs](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/91)
- [Update x86_64 dependency to version 0.8.3](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/92) by [@vinaychandra](https://github.com/vinaychandra)

Since I focused my time on the new _Allocator Designs_ post, I did not have the time to make more progress on my plan to rewrite the 16-bit/32-bit stages of the bootloader in Rust. I hope to get back to it soon.

## `bootimage`

There were no updates to the `bootimage` tool this month.

## `x86_64`

The following changes were merged this month:

- [Allow immediate port version of in/out instructions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/115) by [@m-ou-se](https://github.com/m-ou-se)
- [Make more functions const](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/116) by [@m-ou-se](https://github.com/m-ou-se)
    - Released as version 0.8.3
- [Return the UnusedPhysFrame on MapToError::PageAlreadyMapped](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/118) by [@haraldh](https://github.com/haraldh)
    - This is a **breaking change** since it changes the signature of a type.
    - No new release was published yet to give us the option to bundle it with other breaking changes.

There are also some pull requests that have some open design questions and are still being discussed:

- [Add p23_insert_flag_mask argument to mapper.map_to()](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/114) by [@haraldh](https://github.com/haraldh)
    - Related proposal: [Page Table Visitors](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/issues/121) by [@mark-i-m](https://github.com/mark-i-m)
- [Add User Mode registers](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/119) by [@vinaychandra](https://github.com/vinaychandra)

Please feel free to join these discussions if you have opinions on the matter.

## `cargo-xbuild`

The `cargo-xbuild` crate, which cross-compiles the sysroot, received the following updates this month:

- [Override target path for building sysroot](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild/pull/52) by [@upsuper](https://github.com/upsuper)
    - Published as version 0.5.21

## `uart_16550`

The `uart_16550` crate, which provides basic support for uart_16550 serial output, received a small dependency update:

- [Update dependency for x86_64](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/pull/4) by [@haraldh](https://github.com/haraldh)
    - Published as version 0.2.2
